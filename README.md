## ðŸ§Š Summary

In this study, we constrain the amount of melt due to processes that lower surface albedo and reduce cloud cover by developing a reference system approach that can be applied to satellite measurements of surface albedo and downward atmospheric radiative fluxes. Our findings provide a benchmark for assessing surface radiative feedbacks in state-of-the-art ice sheet models used to forecast Greenland's contribution to global sea levels in the next century and beyond.
